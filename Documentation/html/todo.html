The 4 categories give a rough time as to when a task should be done, 
and reflect an assessment of the task's ease multiplied by its importance. 
Thus, multiple edges is extremely important but not easy, so it falls into 
category 2. The following denote owners:<br>
ERG=<A HREF=mailto:erg@graphviz.org>Emden Gansner</A><br>
JCE=<A HREF=mailto:ellson@graphviz.org>John Ellson</A><br>
SCN=<A HREF=mailto:ellson@graphviz.org>Stephen North</A><br>

<H2>Category 3</H2>
<pre>
Generic label placement, with and without modifying the graph layout
Modifications to Voronoi node overlap adjustment
 - eliminate the nonlinear adjustment
 - use convex hull or other boundary rather than bounding box
Node overlap adjustment strategies sensitive to edges
Make drivers dynamic
Edge routing variations: line segments, orthogonal, polyline, splines
Generalized port/spline routing
Orthogonal layouts
User-defined nodes in all code generators
New dot techniques: 
  symmetrize layouts
  speed up edge crossing counting
  Built-in support for better aspect ratios
  Ulrik's improvements with network simplex
  Better aspect ratio
Spline router improvement (Gordon's improvements, alpha adjustments, less
  inflection points)
Graph language improvements
  local name spaces
  subclassing
  graph databases
